Given a dataset of forest, we have to work or way through it using data science 
The dataset contains columns of various types of soils, types of hydrology, elevation etc. 
We have to use the data according to our own uderstanding and make some predictions based on that.
Using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K- neighbors classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, I predict the cover type of the forest.
